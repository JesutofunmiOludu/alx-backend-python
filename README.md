# 🧠 Advanced Python Generators Project

## 📘 About the Project
This project explores **advanced usage of Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world data streaming scenarios.

Through this project, you will learn to **leverage Python’s `yield` keyword** to implement generators that enable **iterative data access**, **lazy loading**, and **memory-efficient computations** — all of which are essential for performance optimization in data-driven applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Master Python Generators**  
  Learn how to create and use generators for iterative data processing and memory-efficient workflows.

- **Handle Large Datasets**  
  Implement batch processing and lazy loading techniques to manage extensive datasets without exhausting system memory.

- **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**  
  Develop generator-based solutions that simulate live data updates and apply them in streaming or continuous data processing contexts.

- **Optimize Performance**  
  Use generators to compute aggregate functions (e.g., averages, totals) on large datasets while minimizing resource consumption.

- **Integrate Python with SQL**  
  Apply SQL queries to dynamically fetch and process data, combining Python and database operations for robust data management.
